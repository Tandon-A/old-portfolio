Majored in Mechanical Engineering and having an interest in the field of Computer Science, I enjoy working on problems requiring interdisciplinary knowledge. The intersection of these two domains, I believe, has the potential to solve challenging problems affecting a large user base. 

The domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) intrigues me and I have been exploring AI by taking up courses, through internships, by reading research papers and trying to implement them. Working on projects, I have developed a liking for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as they allow a creative set of applications to come true. 

Recently, I have started writing blog posts to give back to the AI community.  

Other than coding, I love reading, be it novels or blogs.
